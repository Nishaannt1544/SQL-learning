## What is a Stored Procedure (SP)? ##
A Stored Procedure is a set of SQL statements that are saved in the database and can be reused whenever needed.
It is like a function in programming: you call it, and it performs a task (e.g., inserting data, retrieving records, updating tables).
Why Use SPs?
Reduces repetition of code.
Improves performance by reducing query parsing.
Adds security by hiding SQL logic.

### Types of Stored Procedures ###
SQL Server categorizes the stored procedures mainly in two types:

User-defined Stored Procedures
System Stored Procedures
